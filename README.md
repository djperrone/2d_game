# 2d_game
As seen in the Description of this repo, this was made using a tutorial on youtube found here https://www.youtube.com/c/CarlBirch/playlists - in the "How to Make a Game in C++ & SDL2 From Scratch!" playlist. The code is not mine but I did my best to understand it without blindly copying it and made slight adjustments like in the input controls.

In this project, I made a basic 2d animated character that is user-controlled and can walk around a map and collide with objects.
